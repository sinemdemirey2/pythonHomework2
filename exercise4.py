Define a Point3D class that inherits from object Inside the Point3D class, define an __init__() function that accepts self, x, y, and z,
and assigns these numbers to the member variables self.x,self.y,self.z. Define a __repr__() method that returns "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z).
This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: (x, y, z). Outside the class definition,
create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3. Finally, print my_point.
